## Motivation
Given a low resolution picture of a flower, enhance it to have 8 times greater resolution with the least loss of quality. Participating in this as part of a competition for Qualcomm employees, I used this opportunity to learn about Generative Adversial Networks.

## Dataset
The dataset is comprised of images of flowers.  The training set has 5000 images of flowers that have been resized.  The test set has 670 images of flowers.  The input size is 32x32 pixels and the output size is 256x256 pixels.

## Important Learnings
1) Had fun implementing and running GANs. They seem to be a really intuitive concept and gets up hopeful about achieving general intelligence. 
2) As part of the project, I also experimented with different loss functions and observed, emperically, how they affect the training. 
3) I also learnt that there is a important mindset change that is required while changing from traditional software development and experimental ML work. ML training requires an experiemental approach, wherein we carefully analyze a problem statement at hand, analyze the hypothesis, assumption and then run the experiment. A lot more patience is desired.
